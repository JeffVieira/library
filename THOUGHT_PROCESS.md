## ðŸ§  Thought Process

1. **Project Setup & Authentication**  
   I started by creating the project and setting up authentication using the `rails generate authorization` command. I implemented JWT-based authentication to handle secure user login and token management, which fits well with an API-only application.

2. **Book Entity**  
   Next, I created the `Book` model to manage the main entity of the app. This included fields like title, author, genre, ISBN, and available copies, allowing full CRUD operations on books.

3. **Permissions with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**  
   I implemented a permission system using the `pundit_roles` gem to define roles and access levels. This approach made it easy to separate permissions between admins and members, and felt like a good fit for the scope and complexity of the challenge.

4. **Borrow and Return Logic**  
   I built the borrow and return features by establishing a many-to-many relationship between users and books via a `borrows` table. This table stores relevant data like the borrowing user, the book, return status, and due date.

5. **Dashboard by User Role**  
   I created a dynamic dashboard that adapts its content based on the userâ€™s role. For admins, it shows totals, due books, and members with overdue items. For members, it displays borrowed and overdue books.

6. **Serialization Layer**  
   I added a serialization layer using `ActiveModel::Serializer` to structure JSON responses. This helps keep the presentation logic clean and manageable while enabling flexible output based on the context (e.g., different views for admin vs member).

7. **API Documentation & Testing**  
   Finally, I documented the API endpoints and provided a Postman collection. I included instructions for setting up environment variables (like the JWT token and base URL) to simplify testing.
